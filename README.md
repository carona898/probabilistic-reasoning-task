**Experiment DOI:** https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/4DGBY

**Functions assessed:** cognitive bias

## Features

**Languages:** English

**Accessibility:** Hearing impairment

**Modalities:** fmri, eeg

**Devices:** Computer

**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Development

**Software:** NBS Presentation (version 17)

**Requirements:** 2-button response box or mouse/keyboard required

## Administration
Run this task using NBS Presentation.

## Procedure and Conditions
This task includes several practice and experimental trials. Participants are asked whether the central fish came from the green lake. Practice trials provde different options for response times (to gradually become comfortable responding within 4 seconds). There are 4 conditions based on whether the central fish matched or did not match the green lake (Match/Non-Match) and whether the probabilities provided strong or weak evidence for the hypothesis.

## Output Files
Log files are output to calculate event timing.

## Scoring
- accuracy
- reaction time
